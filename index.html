            <p>Early in March 2020, people across the world were running their daily schedules and even planning
                international trips for the summer. School children were all set to finish their exams and dive into
                their summer vacation. Unfortunately, on this day last year, everything took a turn for the world’s
                population.
                The coronavirus had made its way to countries across the world. With the increasing number of positive
                cases and deaths, country leaders called for complete lockdowns in their respective nations. March 25th
                marks the day of the <b>‘Janata Curfew’</b> called by Prime Minister <b>Narendra Modi</b> across India.
                In this pandemic situation, the frontline health workers played a significant role in decreasing the
                spread of covid-19. Taking care of the patient to vaccinating everyone, they did everything as much they
                can possible to stop the pandemic. Even though they have their own family, but without much thinking
                about them, they did their job and earned all our respect.
                Here is a small tribute to them from our side.</p>

            <p>In these torrid times, our doctors have been serving day and night, like the soldiers who guard our
                borders,
                to protect millions of lives.
                From being witnesses to so many deaths around them to working tirelessly without a break to getting
                themselves self-quarantined due to the fear of taking the virus home, the doctors were driven to the
                breaking point many a times during the pandemic. It has been an emotionally and physically exhausting
                journey for doctors – both at the personal and professional level.</p>

        <div >After fighting an intense COVID-19 battle, 55-year-old neurosurgeon Dr Simon Hercules from
            Chennai, Tamil Nadu, laid down his life on April 19, 2020. According to reports, they say that Dr Simon, who
            has treated hundreds of patients, was remembered for putting humanity first.
            But what was heartbreaking is that his family couldn’t even give their last goodbyes. In fact, the locals of
            Kilpauk (Chennai) didn’t allow a proper burial for the doctor stating that it could spread the virus, not at
            the cemetery even. Finally, Dr Pradeep, Simon’s colleague, managed to bury him along with the officials late
            at night when the crowds were asleep.</div>

Dr. Li's warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive imaging studies, but on his own understanding of biological plausibility—the kind of analysis that clinicians of all specialties could make.The New York Times reported that on January 10, 2020, Dr Li developed a cough after having treated a woman for glaucoma who had unknowingly been infected with the coronavirus, probably by her daughter. No report suggests that he observed any ophthalmologic complications of the coronavirus infection in his patient.</div>
